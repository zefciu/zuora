# **d_elete_workflow**
> DeleteWorkflowSuccess d_elete_workflow(authorization, workflow_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id)

Delete a workflow

Deletes a specific workflow by its ID.  ## User Access Permission You must be assigned the **Workflow Manage Access** permission to run this operation. 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.WorkflowsApi(api_client)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | `Bearer {token}` for a valid OAuth token. 
workflow_id = 'workflow_id_example' # str | The unique ID of a workflow. For example, 19080. 
zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)

    try:
        # Delete a workflow
        api_response = api_instance.d_elete_workflow(authorization, workflow_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:

# **p_ost_workflow_versions_import**
> WorkflowDefinition p_ost_workflow_versions_import(workflow_id, version, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, activate=activate, request=request)

Import a workflow version

Create a new workflow version under a workflow definition using the exported JSON document of an existing workflow version.  ## User Access Permission You must be assigned the **Workflow Manage Access** permission to run this operation. 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.WorkflowsApi(api_client)
    workflow_id = 56 # int | The unique id of the workflow definition to import a workflow version under.
version = 'version_example' # str | The version number of the new workflow version to import. Must be greater than any existing version numbers.
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
activate = True # bool | Indicates whether the imported version is an active version. Default to be false. (optional)
request = openapi_client.InlineObject2() # InlineObject2 |  (optional)

    try:
        # Import a workflow version
        api_response = api_instance.p_ost_workflow_versions_import(workflow_id, version, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, activate=activate, request=request)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling WorkflowsApi->p_ost_workflow_versions_import: %s\n" % e)
```

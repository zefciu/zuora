Multi-entity: Provision an entity

**Note:** The Multi-entity feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/).   Provisions an entity. You can only provision an entity if its parent entity is provisioned.  ## User Access Permission You must make the call as a global entity administrator.   ## Notes * Zuora does not allow you to remove a provisioned entity from the multi-entity hierarchy. So before you provision an entity, make sure that you put the entity in the correct place in the multi-entity hierarchy.  

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.EntitiesApi(api_client)
    id = 'id_example' # str | Specify the Id of the entity that you want to provision.  You can get the entity Id from the GET Entities call.
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)

    try:
        # Multi-entity: Provision an entity
        api_response = api_instance.p_ut_provision_entity(id, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling EntitiesApi->p_ut_provision_entity: %s\n" % e)
```

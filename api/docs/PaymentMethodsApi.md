Delete a payment method

Deletes a credit card payment method.  If the specified payment method is the account's default payment method, the request will fail.  In that case, you must first designate a different payment method for that customer to be the default.  For a use case of this operation, see [Configure Payment Methods](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/#Configure-payment-methods). 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.PaymentMethodsApi(api_client)
    payment_method_id = 'payment_method_id_example' # str | Unique identifier of a payment method. (Since this ID is unique, and linked to a customer account in the system, no customer identifier is needed.)
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)

    try:
        # Delete a payment method
        api_response = api_instance.d_elete_payment_methods(payment_method_id, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:

> ModifiedStoredCredentialProfileResponse p_ost_cancel_stored_credential_profile(payment_method_id, profile_number, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Cancel a stored credential profile

Cancels a stored credential profile within a payment method.  Cancelling the stored credential profile indicates that the stored credentials are no longer valid, per a customer request. You cannot reactivate the stored credential profile after you have cancelled it.  **Note:** This feature is in the **Early Adopters** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing as generally available.

# **p_ost_create_authorization**
> POSTAuthorizeResponse p_ost_create_authorization(payment_method_id, request, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Create authorization

Enables you to authorize the availability of funds for a transaction but delay the capture of funds until a later time. Subsequently, use [CRUD: Create a payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTPayment) or [Create a payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreatePayment) to capture the authorized funds, or use [Cancel authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CancelAuthorization) to cancel the authorization.   The following payment gateways support this operation:  * Adyen Integration v2.0 * CyberSource 1.28 * CyberSource 1.97 * CyberSource 2.0 - This gateway supports the Delayed Capture feature for both Credit Cards and Credit Card Reference payment methods. This gateway does not support [Cancel authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CancelAuthorization). * Chase Paymentech Orbital * Ingenico ePayments * SlimPay * Verifi Global Payment Gateway  If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, use the [Create payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreatePayment) operation to capture the funds instead of the [CRUD: Create payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTPayment) operation.

> ModifiedStoredCredentialProfileResponse p_ost_create_stored_credential_profile(payment_method_id, request, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Create a stored credential profile

Creates a stored credential profile within a payment method.  The stored credential profile represents a consent agreement that you have established with a customer. When you use the payment method in a transaction, Zuora may include information from the stored credential profile to inform the payment processor that the transaction is related to your pre-existing consent agreement with the customer.  **Note:** This feature is in the **Early Adopters** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing as generally available.

# **p_ut_scrub_payment_methods**
> CommonResponseType p_ut_scrub_payment_methods(payment_method_id, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Scrub a payment method

 This operation enables you to replace all sensitive data in a payment method, related payment method snapshot table, and four related log tables with dummy values that will be stored in Zuora databases.   This operation will scrub the sensitive data and soft-delete the specified payment method at the same time.   If you want to delete or anonymize personal data in Zuora, you must scrub the payment method before anonymizing the associated account and contact. See [Delete or anonymize personal data](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Responding_to_individual_requests_for_access%2C_correction%2C_and_deletion_of_data_under_applicable_privacy_laws#Edit_and_correct_personal_data) for more information.  **Note:** In order to use this operation, you must ensure that the **Scrub Sensitive Data of Specific Payment Method payments** permission is enabled in your user role. Contact your tenant administrator if you want to enable this permission. See [Scrub Payment Methods](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/L_Payment_Methods/Scrub_Payment_Methods) for more information.

# **p_ut_verify_payment_methods**
> PUTVerifyPaymentMethodResponseType p_ut_verify_payment_methods(payment_method_id, body, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id)

Verify a payment method

Sends an authorization request to the corresponding payment gateway to verify the payment method, even though no changes are made for the payment method. Supported payment methods are Credit Cards and Paypal.  Zuora now supports performing a standalone zero dollar verification or one dollar authorization for credit cards. It also supports a billing agreement status check on PayPal payment methods.  If a payment method is created by Hosted Payment Pages and is not assigned to any billing account, the payment method cannot be verified through this operation. 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.

    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.PaymentMethodsApi(api_client)
    payment_method_id = 'payment_method_id_example' # str | The ID of the payment method to be verified. 
body = openapi_client.PUTVerifyPaymentMethodType() # PUTVerifyPaymentMethodType | 
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)

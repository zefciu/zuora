Establish a connection to Zuora REST API

Establishes a connection to the Zuora REST API service based on a valid user credentials.   **Note:**This is a legacy REST API. Zuora recommends you to use [OAuth](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/OAuth-v2.0) for authentication instead.   This call authenticates the user and returns an API session cookie that's used to authorize subsequent calls to the REST API. The credentials must belong to a user account that has permission to access the API service.  As noted elsewhere, it's strongly recommended that an account used for Zuora API activity is never used to log into the Zuora UI.  Once an account is used to log into the UI, it may be subject to periodic forced password changes, which may eventually lead to authentication failures when using the API. 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.ConnectionsApi(api_client)
    api_access_key_id = 'api_access_key_id_example' # str | Account username 
api_secret_access_key = 'api_secret_access_key_example' # str | Account password 
content_type = 'content_type_example' # str | Must be set to \"application/json\" 
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)

    try:
        # Establish a connection to Zuora REST API
        api_response = api_instance.p_ost_connections(api_access_key_id, api_secret_access_key, content_type, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ConnectionsApi->p_ost_connections: %s\n" % e)
```

**auth_transaction_id** | **str** | The authorization transaction ID from the payment gateway. Use this field for electronic payments, such as credit cards.  When you create a payment for capturing the authorized funds, it is highly recommended to pass in the gatewayOrderId that you used when authorizing the funds by using the [Create authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateAuthorization) operation, together with the &#x60;authTransactionId&#x60; field.  The following payment gateways support this field:   - Adyen Integration v2.0   - CyberSource 1.28   - CyberSource 1.97   - CyberSource 2.0   - Chase Paymentech Orbital   - Ingenico ePayments   - SlimPay   - Verifi Global Payment Gateway   - WePay Payment Gateway Integration  | [optional]

**gateway_order_id** | **str** | A merchant-specified natural key value that can be passed to the electronic payment gateway when a payment is created. If not specified, the payment number will be passed in instead.  Gateways check duplicates on the gateway order ID to ensure that the merchant do not accidentally enter the same transaction twice. This ID can also be used to do reconciliation and tie the payment to a natural key in external systems. The source of this ID varies by merchant. Some merchants use their shopping cart order IDs, and others use something different. Merchants use this ID to track transactions in their eCommerce systems.  When you create a payment for capturing the authorized funds, it is highly recommended to pass in the gatewayOrderId that you used when authorizing the funds by using the [Create authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateAuthorization) operation, together with the &#x60;authTransactionId&#x60; field.  | [optional]

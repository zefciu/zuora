**specific_trigger_date** | **date** | Date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Only applicable if the value of the &#x60;triggerEvent&#x60; field is &#x60;SpecificDate&#x60;.   While this field is applicable, if this field is not set, your &#x60;CreateSubscription&#x60; order action creates a &#x60;Pending&#x60; order and a &#x60;Pending Acceptance&#x60; subscription.

List all results of a mass action

Describes how to get information about the result of a mass action through the REST API.  

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.MassUpdaterApi(api_client)
    bulk_key = 'bulk_key_example' # str | String of 32 characters that identifies a mass action. You get the bulk-key after performing a mass action through the REST API. 
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)

    try:
        # List all results of a mass action
        api_response = api_instance.g_et_mass_updater(bulk_key, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling MassUpdaterApi->g_et_mass_updater: %s\n" % e)
```

Perform a mass action

Describes how to perform a mass action through the REST API.   Using this API method, you send a multipart/form-data request containing a `.csv` file with data about the mass action you want to perform. Zuora returns a key and then asynchronously processes the mass action. You can use the key to get details about the result of the mass action.  If you want to use this operation to perform the Mass Payment Upload (MPU) mass action, see [Mass Payment Upload](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Finance/Mass_Updater/Mass_Payment_Upload) for more information.

Stop a mass action

Describes how to stop a mass action through the REST API. You can stop a mass action when its status is Pending or Processing. After you have stopped a mass action, you can get the mass action result to see details of the mass action.  - If you stop a mass action when its status is Pending, no response file is generated because no records have been processed.  - If you stop a mass action when its status is Processing, a response file is generated. You can check the response file to see which records have been processed and which have not. In the response file, the **Success** column has the value `Y` (successful) or `N` (failed) for processed records, and a blank value for unprocessed records.  Records that have already been processed when a mass action is stopped are not rolled back.

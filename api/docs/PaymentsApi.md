**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Retrieves the information about a specific payment part. A payment can consist of an unapplied part, and several parts applied to invoices and debit memos. 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.PaymentsApi(api_client)
    partid = 'partid_example' # str | The unique ID of a specific payment part. You can get the payment part ID from the response of [List all parts of a payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_PaymentParts). 
payment_id = 'payment_id_example' # str | The unique ID of a payment. For example, 8a8082e65b27f6c3015b89e4344c16b1. 
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)

    try:
        # Retrieve a payment part
        api_response = api_instance.g_et_payment_part(partid, payment_id, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Creates a payment in the following scenarios:  - A full or partial payment on an invoice or a debit memo - A full or partial payment on several invoices and debit memos - An unapplied payment in the following situations:   - You do not know which customer account the payment belongs to.   - You know which customer account the payment belongs to, but you do not know which invoice the payment is applied to.   - You receive a payment from your customer that exceeds the balance on the invoice.   - You receive a payment from your customer before the invoice has been created.   - You intend to create a payment without any invoices or debit memos. - A standalone payment. If you only need to create and process an electronic payment in Zuora through a Zuora gateway integration but settle the payment outside of Zuora, you can create a standalone payment. For a standalone payment, you can specify a currency different from the payment currency in the customer account settings.     The support for standalone payments is in the Early Adopter phase. If you want to use this feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/) to enable it.  If you do not know to which customer account the payment belongs, you can create a payment without specifying a customer account.  When you create a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will apply to should be less than or equal to 10,000.  For more information, see [Create Payments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/AA_Create_Payments) and [Create Payments Without Specifying Customer Accounts](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/AA_Create_Payments_Without_Specifying_Customer_Accounts).

# **p_ut_unapply_payment**
> GETARPaymentType p_ut_unapply_payment(payment_id, body, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Unapply a payment

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Unapplies an applied payment from invoices and debit memos.  When you unapply a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will unapply from must be less than or equal to 10,000.  If the limit is hit, you can follow the instructions: - If you want to unapply one payment without specifying invoices or debit memos, you have to specify the invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to unapply one payment from multiple specified invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to unapply one payment from a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.  For more information, see [Unapply Payments from Invoices and Debit Memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/Unapply_Payments_from_Invoices_and_Debit_Memos).

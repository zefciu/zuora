> ProxyCreateOrModifyResponse object_post_refund(create_request, reject_unknown_fields=reject_unknown_fields, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id)

CRUD: Create a refund

Creates a refund.   If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, you can use this operation to unapply the payment from an invoice or multiple invoices, and refund the payment.   If the unapplied payment is left in the following scenarios, you have to reapply the unapplied payment to the original invoices:  - An electronic refund in Processing status is handled to change to Error. An unapplied payment is left.  - An electronic refund gets to Error, and payment reapplying fails due to the concurrent issue.  - The refund canceling operation updates the status of a refund from Processed to Canceled. When it is successful, an unapplied payment is left.

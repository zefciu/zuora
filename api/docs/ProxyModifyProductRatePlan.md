If the request body contains this field, the value of this field must contain the desired list of active currencies. The new list can never have more than four differences from the existing list.  This field cannot be used to modify the status of more than four currencies in a single request. For example, in a single request, you can only activate four currencies, or deactivate four currencies, or activate two and deactivate two. Making more than four changes to currencies always requires more than one call.

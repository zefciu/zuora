```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:

    rs_number = 'rs_number_example' # str |  Revenue schedule number of the revenue schedule you want to delete, for example, RS-00000256. To be deleted, the revenue schedule: * Must be using a custom unlimited recognition rule. * Cannot have any revenue in a closed accounting period. * Cannot be included in a summary journal entry. * Cannot have a revenue schedule date in a closed accounting period. 
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers.

Retrieve a revenue schedule by invoice item adjustment key

Retrieves the details of a revenue schedule by specifying a valid invoice item adjustment identifier. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided. 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.RevenueSchedulesApi(api_client)
    invoice_item_adj_key = 'invoice_item_adj_key_example' # str | ID of the Invoice Item Adjustment, for example, e20b07fd416dcfcf0141c81164fd0a72.
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.

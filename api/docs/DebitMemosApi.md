List debit memo items

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Retrieves the information about all items of a debit memo. A debit memo item is a single line item in a debit memo.   ### Filtering  You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body.  If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.   Examples:  - /v1/debitmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40b28001f/items?amount=100  - /v1/debitmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40b28001f/items?amount=100&sort=createdDate

By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by debit memo number.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - number   - accountId   - debitMemoDate   - targetDate   - dueDate   - amount   - taxAmount   - totalTaxExemptAmount   - balance   - beAppliedAmount   - referredInvoiceId   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById    Examples:  - /v1/debitmemos?sort&#x3D;+number  - /v1/debitmemos?status&#x3D;Processed&amp;sort&#x3D;-number,+amount  | [optional]

> DebitMemoCollectResponse p_ost_debit_memo_collect(debit_memo_id, body, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Collect a posted debit memo

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.  This API operation provides an easy way to let the client-side to collect an existing posted debit memo. It supports the following steps:   1. Apply unapplied credit memos to the posted debit memo by Oldest-First-Largest-First rule if there are more than one unapplied credit memos.   2. Apply unapplied payments to the posted debit memo by Oldest-First-Largest-First rule if there are more than one unapplied payments.   3. Process payment to the posted debit memo if there is an open-balance on it.  **Reistrictions**  Since this API will do lots of works, and some of them are resource consuming, we need to resitrict the usage of this API by the following conditions:   1. If the target debit memo gets more than 10 debit memo items, the request will be rejected.   2. If `CreditMemo` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 25 credit memos will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.   3. If `CreditMemo` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 100 credit memo items will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.   4. If `UnappliedPayment` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 25 payments will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.

Update a debit memo

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled.

Updates the basic and finance information about a debit memo. Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items.   If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:   - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.   - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.  You can update a debit memo only if you have the user permission.

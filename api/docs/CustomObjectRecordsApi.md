List records for a custom object

Lists all object records of the given type. You can also use the `q` query parameter to filter the output records.  ## Limitations   This call has the following limitations: * When a record is created, there will be a delay before it is available for search. For example, if you create 5 records and perform a query that these 5 records satisfy the query conditions, there will be a delay between when the 5 records are created, and when all the 5 records can be returned in the query result.

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **authorization** | **str**| &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; for a valid OAuth token.  | 
 **object** | **str**| Specifies the custom object&#39;s API name as object. It is case-sensitive. | 
 **id** | [**str**](.md)| Id identifier in uuid form | 
 **object_record_patch_request** | [**dict(str, object)**](object.md)|  | 
 **zuora_track_id** | **str**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **zuora_version** | **date**| API version that determines the response schema. The default version is used if this parameter is not included. Specify &#x60;Zuora-Version&#x60; in the request header if you expect a specific response schema. | [optional]

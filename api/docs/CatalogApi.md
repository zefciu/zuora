### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.CatalogApi(api_client)
    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
page = 1 # int | Page number.  (optional) (default to 1)
page_size = 10 # int | Number of rows returned per page.  (optional) (default to 10)
zuora_version = 'zuora_version_example' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You only need to set this parameter if you use the `productRatePlans` field.  (optional)

    try:
        # List all products

Multi-entity: Share a product with an entity

**Note:** The Multi-entity feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/).  Shares a product with a target entity. Zuora synchronizes the shared products to the target entity after sharing. For more information about product sharing, see [Products Sharing Across Entities](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/C_Business_Objects_Sharing_Across_Entities/B_Products_Sharing_Across_Entities).  Note that:  - You must finish all the [prerequisites](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/C_Business_Objects_Sharing_Across_Entities/B_Products_Sharing_Across_Entities/Share_Products) before sharing products with other entities.   - Only source entity administrators have permission to share products with other entities. You must make the call as a source entity administrator.  - Currently, you can only share a product with one entity at a time. An error occurs if you try to share a product to more than one entity.

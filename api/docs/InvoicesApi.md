> GETCreditMemoType p_ost_credit_memo_from_invoice(invoice_id, body, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_version=zuora_version)

Create a credit memo from an invoice

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Creates an ad-hoc credit memo from an invoice.  You can create a credit memo from an invoice only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.  For a use case of this operation, see [Create credit memo](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/#Create-credit-memo).  Zero-amount memo items are supported in the following scenarios: - If you want to correct taxation items only for an invoice, you can set the memo item amount to zero, but the taxation item amount to non-zero. - If you want to correct personal data in an invoice, you can set the memo item amount to zero to create a zero-amount credit memo from an invoice.

> PUTWriteOffInvoiceResponse p_ut_write_off_invoice(invoice_id, request, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Write off an invoice

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

Writes off a posted invoice.   By writing off an invoice, a credit memo is created and applied to the invoice. The generated credit memo items and credit memo taxation items are applied to invoice items and invoice taxation items based on the configured default application rule. If an invoice is written off, the balance of each invoice item and invoice taxation item must be zero.  If you set the **Create credit memos mirroring invoice items billing rule** to **Yes**, you can write off an invoice even if all its items have zero balance.  **Restrictions**  You cannot write off an invoice if any of the following restrictions is met:  * The balance of an invoice has been changed before Invoice Settlement is enabled.    For example, before Invoice Settlement is enabled, any credit balance adjustments, invoice item adjustments, or invoice adjustments have been applied to an invoice.  * An invoice contains more than 2,000 items in total, including invoice items, discount items, and taxation items.

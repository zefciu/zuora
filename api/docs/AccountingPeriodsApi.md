You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.  Limitations ----------- * The accounting period cannot already be closed. * The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance. * All earlier accounting periods must be closed. * There must be no required action items for the accounting period.

# **p_ut_pending_close_accounting_period**
> CommonResponseType p_ut_pending_close_accounting_period(ap_id, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Set an accounting period to pending close

Sets an accounting period to pending close.   Prerequisites -------------  * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant. * You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.               Limitations   -----------    * The accounting period cannot be closed or pending close.    * The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.    * All earlier accounting periods must be closed.     Notes ----- When you set an accounting period to pending close in Zuora, a trial balance is automatically run for that period. A response of `{ \"success\": true }`  means only that the accounting period status is now pending close, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed. You can use the Get Accounting Period REST API call to view details about the outcome of the trial balance. 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function

from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.AccountingPeriodsApi(api_client)
    ap_id = 'ap_id_example' # str | ID of the accounting period you want to set to pending close.
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)

# **p_ut_update_accounting_period**
> CommonResponseType p_ut_update_accounting_period(ap_id, request, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Update an accounting period

 Updates an accounting period.  Prerequisites -------------  * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.  * You must have the Create Accounting Period user permission. See [Finance Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/f_Finance_Roles).  Limitations -----------  * You can update the start date of only the earliest accounting period on your tenant. You cannot update the start date of later periods.  * If you update the earliest accounting period, the start date must be equal to or earlier than the date of the earliest transaction on the tenant.  * Start and end dates of accounting periods must be contiguous. For example, if one accounting period ends on January 31, the next period must start on February 1.  * If you have the Revenue Recognition Package and have enabled the \"Monthly recognition over time\" revenue recognition model, the accounting period start date and end date must be on the first day and last day of the month, respectively. Note that the start and end dates do not necessarily have to be in the same month.  * You cannot update the start date or end date of an accounting period if:   * Any revenue has been distributed into the period.   * The period has any active journal entries.

Retrieves the information about all items of a credit memo. A credit memo item is a single line item in a credit memo.   ### Filtering  You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body.  If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.   Examples:        - /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100      - /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100&sort=createdDate

When you apply a credit memo, the total number of credit memo items and the items that credit memo items to be applied to must be less than or equal to 10,000.  If the limit is hit, you can follow the following instructions:  - If you want to apply one credit memo to multiple invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to apply one credit memo to a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items or debit memo items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items or debit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000. - If a credit memo has a large volume of items, you have to specify credit memo items in the request. The maximum number of credit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.          If the Proration application rule is used, when applying credit memos, the following quantity must be less than or equal to 10,000:   (number of invoice items + number of debit memo items) * number of credit memo items  Otherwise, the First In First Out rule will be used instead of the Proration rule.

> GETCreditMemoType p_ut_unapply_credit_memo(credit_memo_id, body, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Unapply a credit memo

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

Unapplies an applied credit memo from one or more invoices and debit memos. The full applied amount from invoices and debit memos is transferred into the unapplied amount of the credit memo.   You can unapply a credit memo from an invoice or a debit memo only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.  When you unapply a credit memo, the total number of credit memo items and the items that credit memo items to be unapplied from must be less than or equal to 10,000.  If the limit is hit, you can follow the following instructions:  - If you want to unapply one credit memo without specifying invoices or debit memos, you have to specify the invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to unapply one credit memo from multiple specified invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to unapply one credit memo from a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items or debit memo items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items or debit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000. - If a credit memo has a large volume of items, you have to specify credit memo items in the request. The maximum number of credit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.   If the Proration application rule is used, when unapplying credit memos, the following quantity must be less than or equal to 10,000:   (number of invoice items + number of debit memo items) * number of credit memo items  Otherwise, the First In First Out rule will be used instead of the Proration rule.

# **p_ut_update_credit_memo**
> GETCreditMemoType p_ut_update_credit_memo(credit_memo_id, body, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)

Update a credit memo

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Updates the basic and finance information about a credit memo. Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items.   If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:   - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.   - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.  You can update a credit memo only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information. 

### Example

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.CreditMemosApi(api_client)
    credit_memo_id = 'credit_memo_id_example' # str | The unique ID of a credit memo. For example, 8a8082e65b27f6c3015ba45ff82c7172.  
body = openapi_client.PUTCreditMemoType() # PUTCreditMemoType | 
zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)

    try:
        # Update a credit memo
        api_response = api_instance.p_ut_update_credit_memo(credit_memo_id, body, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling CreditMemosApi->p_ut_update_credit_memo: %s\n" % e)
```
